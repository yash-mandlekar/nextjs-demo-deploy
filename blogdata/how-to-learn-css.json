  "content": "Css is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Css supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Css itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.",
